## Low Power FPGA-based Hardware Accelerator for Autonomous Navigation of Mobile Robots

My research was on power optimization of autonomous mobile robot navigation in which I designed and developed hardware-software co-design architecture for optimizing computational power of local planner of ROS navigation stack with FPGA hardware accelerator. The resulting component is consuming less power to a degree of four and faster due to C++ implementation on Linux platform.
