## Education
### University of Moratuwa
* Bachelor of the Science of Engineering in Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering with Honors, 2020 
* Final year research on Power optimized navigation of mobile robots.

## Work experience
* 2021 - Present: Research Engineer
  * E-consulate, affiliated with Intellisense Lab, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka
  * Supervisors: Dr. Sulochana Sooriyaarachchi & Dr. Chandana Gamage
  * Summary: The Intellisense Lab focuses on building mobile robot systems for exploration of an unknown area. I am currently developing robust navigation components, and testing those on Gazebo simulation with a custom-made robot. The development is on ROS and C++. 

* 2020 - 2021: Embedded Research Engineer
  * SenzMate, Sri Lanka
  * Summary: During the pandemic, I worked on an initiative to serve the community by building an AI COVID-19 Wristband. It detects the handwashing pattern of the user using IMU data in real-time and compares it to that of the WHO standard, and reminds the user periodically to wash hands. The implementation was in C and Python.

* 2018: Embedded Research Intern
  * SenzMate, Sri Lanka
  * Summary: We developed a peer-to-peer bidirectional wireless communication module based on the LoRa protocol. The module works as a remote controller and virtual serial link. I was involved in the development of communication protocol for multi-point to multi-point reliable communication and firmware development in C.
