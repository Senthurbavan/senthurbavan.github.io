I am a research engineer at E-consulate, collaborating with Intellisense Lab at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

At Intellisense Lab we are building mobile robot systems with 3D LiDAR and an RGB-D camera for the exploration of an unknown area. I built the SLAM system and developed navigation algorithms in ROS in C++ (based on the ROS navigation stack). I have experience in navigation parameter tuning, point cloud processing and ray-tracing for 2D projection, robot hardware, and robot modeling with physical properties for simulation. Currently I am migrating the code base from ROS to ROS2.

Before joining E-consulate, I was a research engineer at SenzMate. I worked on an initiative to serve the community by building an AI COVID-19 Wristband. The purpose of the wristband is to detect the handwashing pattern of the user, compare it to that of the WHO standard in real-time and remind the user to wash hands periodically.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020. My final-year research was on the power optimization of mobile robot navigation with an FPGA-based hardware accelerator.
