I am a research engineer at E-consulate, collaborating with Intellisense Lab at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

At Intellisense Lab we are building mobile robot systems for exploration of an unknown area. I am currently developing robust navigation components and recovery behaviors and testing those with the Gazebo simulation model I built for the custom-made robot we use.
<!-- Additionally, I am focusing on building an exploration strategy that processes 3D point cloud maps from the SLAM system and provides 2D navigation goals. -->

Before joining E-consulate, I was an embedded research engineer at SenzMate. I worked on an initiative to serve the community by building an AI COVID-19 Wristband. The purpose of the wristband is to detect the handwashing pattern of the user, compare it to that of the WHO standard in real-time and remind the user to wash hands periodically.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020. My final year research was on power optimization of mobile robot navigation with an FPGA based hardware accelerator.
