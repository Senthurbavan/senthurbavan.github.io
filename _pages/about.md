I am a research engineer at E-consulate, collaborating with Intellisense Lab at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

I am currently working on mobile robot exploration in an unknown environment. The focus of my work is on developing navigation component with proper recovery behavior to retrieve the robot from stuck positions, building a Gazebo simulation model of our custom-made robot for testing, and building exploration strategy which process 3D point cloud map from the SLAM system and providing 2D navigation goals.

Before joining E-consulate, I was an embedded research engineer at SenzMate. I worked on an initiative to serve the community by building an AI COVID-19 Wristband. The purpose of the wristband is to detect the handwashing pattern of the user, compare it to that of the WHO standard and remind the user to wash hands periodically.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020.
