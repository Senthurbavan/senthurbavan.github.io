I am a research engineer at Econsulate, working in collaboration with Intellisense Lab at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

I am currently working on mobile robot exploration in an unknown environment. I am working on extending the current
simulation work to a real-world implementation, mainly focusing on ROS navigation stack.

Before joining Econsulate, I was a embedded research engineer at SenzMate. I worked on an initiative to serve the community by building an AI COVID-19 Wristband. It detects the hand washing pattern of the user and compare it to that of the WHO standard using IMU data, and the implementation was on C, in real-time.

I received my bachelors' degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020.
